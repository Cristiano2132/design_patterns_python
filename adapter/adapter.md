Sure! Here's a markdown example that explains the Adapter Pattern:

# Adapter Pattern

## Definition
The Adapter Pattern is a **structural design pattern** that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate. It acts as a bridge between two interfaces, allowing them to work together seamlessly. The Adapter Pattern involves creating a new class, called the adapter, which wraps the methods of an existing class and provides a unified interface.

## Type of Pattern
The Adapter Pattern is a **structural pattern**, specifically a design pattern that focuses on composition and relationship between classes and objects.

## When to Use
Use the Adapter Pattern when you need to integrate existing classes or components with others that have incompatible interfaces. It's particularly useful when working with third-party libraries or legacy code that cannot be modified but needs to be used in a new context.

## SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The Adapter class has the responsibility of adapting the interfaces and ensuring compatibility between them.
- **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** New adapters can be added without modifying the existing code of the classes being adapted.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Instances of the adapted class and the original class can be used interchangeably as they share a common interface.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** The Adapter pattern promotes creating interfaces that are specific to the needs of clients, preventing bloated interfaces.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The Adapter pattern enables decoupling between client code and the adapted classes, allowing for flexibility in changing implementations.

## Similar Patterns
- **Facade Pattern:** Both patterns provide a simplified interface to a complex subsystem. However, the Adapter pattern focuses on adapting interfaces, while the Facade pattern provides a higher-level interface.

## Main Difference
The main difference between the Adapter and Facade patterns is in their intent and use cases. The Adapter pattern deals with making incompatible interfaces work together, while the Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

## Use Case: Database Connection Adapter

Imagine you are building a new application that interacts with a legacy database system. The legacy database system has its own interface and methods for querying data. However, your application's codebase is designed to work with a modern database library that has a different interface. To integrate the legacy database with your application, you can use the Adapter Pattern.

Here's how the Adapter Pattern can be applied:

1. Define an interface that your application code expects, matching the methods of the modern database library.
2. Create an adapter class that implements this interface and internally uses the methods of the legacy database system.
3. When interacting with the database in your application, use the adapter class to translate the modern database library calls into calls compatible with the legacy database.

By using the Adapter Pattern, your application can seamlessly work with the legacy database without having to modify the existing code that relies on the modern database library.

In summary, the Adapter Pattern is a powerful tool for integrating incompatible interfaces, enabling collaboration between different parts of a system. It's particularly useful when dealing with third-party components, legacy systems, or situations where modifying existing code is not an option. The pattern allows you to create a bridge between disparate interfaces, facilitating a smooth and efficient interaction between components.
